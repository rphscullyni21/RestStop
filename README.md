## Introduction

RestStop is a web application that allows users to find nearby bathrooms in their area quickly and efficiently. The idea is inspired by the "mapty" app created by Jonas Schmedttman, which has been repurposed to serve this specific need.

Whether you're on a road trip, exploring a new city, or simply in need of a restroom in an unfamiliar area, RestStop is here to help you find the nearest facilities with ease.

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Utilize an intuitive map interface to view nearby bathrooms.
- **Filtering Options:** Narrow down your search by facilities type, accessibility, and user ratings.
- **User Reviews and Ratings:** Contribute to the community by leaving reviews and ratings for bathrooms you've visited.
- **Save Favorite Restrooms:** Keep track of your preferred restrooms for future reference.
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Access RestStop on the go with a responsive design optimized for mobile devices.
